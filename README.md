# FakeNews

FakeNews is a rails app that makes it easy to generate fake tweets based on a
given Twitter user's tweet history.

This was created for fun, and to demonstrate writing integration tests for the
Bowling Green Web Developers meetup, in July 2018.

Please only use this for fun and education -- NOT for swaying elections or
harassing anybody. :-)
